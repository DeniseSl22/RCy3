## Approach:

Focus on a function. Read up on the documentation for that function (bottom left of this page: http://rcytoscape.systemsbiology.net/versions/current/index.html which is slightly outdated and the package documentation). Run the function in the old Cytoscape to check what the expected output is. Outcomment the code line by line and use print statements to see what each variable contains and in what format. If there is an xmlrpc command, look up its equivalent in the CyREST documentation (http://idekerlab.github.io/cyREST) if there is an equivalent. If there is not, find different ways how to solve the problem using different CyREST functions or ask Keiono to implement the specific function of interest.
Write test cases and test your code along the way.
